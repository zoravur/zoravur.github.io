I am changing from raw html to the static site generator Hugo. 
As I plan to put more writing on my blog, writing in markdown instead 
of plain HTML will become more important. Stay tuned for overviews of 
system design concepts (as I prepare to find more permanent employment), 
as well as security and statistics.

Get excited.
